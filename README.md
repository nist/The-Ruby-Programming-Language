#The Ruby Programming Language

I bought the book [The Ruby Programming Language](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ruby-programming/9780596516178/) when it was published. I was already a Ruby programmer, a language that I love and was refreshing in a sea of corporate framework (J2EE, .Net). My copy was pretty well wear out, so I throw it in recycle bin a couple of years ago. Yesterday, I found in [a street library](https://www.facebook.com/BibliothequeDeLaRue/) a copy that looks like new. Time to revisit this book by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto and published by
O'Reilly Media in 2008.

I wrote a small Ruby program to illustrate each concept along my reading.

Since I'm a [TDD](https://www.coscreen.co/blog/tdd-and-bdd/#:~:text=TDD%20stands%20for%20test%2Ddriven,development%20of%20the%20production%20code.) advocate, I also wrote the test for it, using the default testing library, `test/unit`.

The book was written when the version 1.9 was coming out.

I use the [latest version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), which could mean some change with the book.
